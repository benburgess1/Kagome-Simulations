     The non-equilibrium time-dynamics of one and two bosons in a kagome lattice are investigated through exact numerical simulations with the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. The kagome bandstructure contains a dispersionless `flat band'; single particles in the flat band are observed to remain stationary indefinitely. Interactions between particles are found to lift the degeneracy of the flat band, enabling transport of bound particle pairs in the weak-interaction limit; for strong interactions, the particles are independently mobile. The strong-interaction eigenspectrum divides into a `scattering' band and a `doublon' band, whose respective dynamical behaviours are analysed. This research provides a detailed microscopic account of the one- and two-boson physics in the kagome lattice across the full range of interaction strengths.
